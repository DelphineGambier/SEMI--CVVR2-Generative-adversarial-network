# EMI--CVVR2-Generative-adversarial-network
The aim of this project is to generate images of apples to build a database that will be used to train other networks using Python and Tensorflow.
## 0 - Requierement 
For this project you need to use [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) to run the code. 
You also need the following libraries and versions (some of them can be already installed in google colaboratory or will be installed directly by running the notebooks) :
```
numpy==1.19.5
matplotlib==3.2.2
scipy==1.4.1
sklearn == 0.22.2.post1
scikit_image==0.16.2
skimage==0.0
keras==2.4.3
keras_nightly==2.5.0.dev2021032900
tensorflow_datasets == 4.0.1
tensorflow == 2.5.0
pillow == 7.1.2
opencv_contrib_python==4.1.2.30
IPython == 5.5.0
```
This project requires pix2pix model for GAN avalable [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples.git) by installing `tensorflow_examples` with :
```python
! pip install -q git+https://github.com/tensorflow/examples.git
```

Download the datasets used [here](https://github.com/DelphineGambier/EMI--CVVR2-Generative-adversarial-network/tree/main/Datasets).  
*(You can also use your own images datasets)*

## I - GAN
## II - Autoencoder
## III - Evaluation 
To evaluate the models we use the [FID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9chet_inception_distance) (Fr√©chet inception distance) : the FID is the performance measure used to evaluate the quality of images created by a generative model.

Find the compute FID in [3-Evaluation](https://github.com/DelphineGambier/EMI--CVVR2-Generative-adversarial-network/tree/main/3-Evaluation).
To calculate de FID you juste have to drag and drop the python files in Google Colaboratory : 

![Evaluation Files](/Ressources/eval_files.png) 

Then create two directories : 'gold' and 'out'
- import your training images (originals) in 'gold' directory
- import your result images in 'out' directory 

**Warning :** There must be the same number of images in both folders. 

Get the FID by entering the following command in Google Colaboratory :
```python
! python compare_output.py -o out -g gold
```
## IV -  To go further
If you want to go deeper into the subject, here are some links to other projects about GANs (but they use Pytorch instead of Tensorflow) :
- GAN that generates foreground and background separately : https://github.com/jwyang/lr-gan.pytorch
- GAN that generates several objects in one image : https://github.com/tohinz/multiple-objects-gan
- GAN that generates an image from coordinates : https://github.com/bioinf-jku/TTUR
